# Hi there, I'm Zouina Kacete 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a **Master's student** in Software Development at **Université Paris Cité**, passionate about **Full-Stack Development** – both backend and frontend.  

💡 I’m always ready for a new challenge (and to discover new lines of code).  
✨ I enjoy breaking down complex problems into simple, creative solutions that are both efficient and enjoyable to use.  

Just don’t ask me to write perfect code on the first try – I’m still searching for "flawless mode"! 😌
